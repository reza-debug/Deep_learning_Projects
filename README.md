# Deep_learning_Projects 
Hi! I'm Reza, a Machine Learning enthusiast.

Quick Overview of Two Projects from the GitHub Repository


1. Detect Number from Handwritten Pictures with Deep Neural Network
Goal: To build a deep neural network model that can accurately recognize handwritten digits from images.
Dataset: The MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.
Model: A convolutional neural network (CNN) with two convolutional layers and two fully-connected layers.
Results: The model achieved an accuracy of 99.7% on the test set.
Code: The code for this project is available in the handwritten_digits folder.


2. Deep Learning Model for Heart Disease Data
Goal: To build a deep learning model that can predict the risk of heart disease based on patient data.
Dataset: The Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, which consists of 303 instances with 14 attributes, including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, and fasting blood sugar.
Model: A multilayer perceptron (MLP) with two hidden layers.
Results: The model achieved an accuracy of 83% on the test set.
Code: The code for this project is available in the heart_disease folder.
Overall, these two projects demonstrate the potential of deep learning for a variety of tasks, including image recognition and medical diagnosis.
